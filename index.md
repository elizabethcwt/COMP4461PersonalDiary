# Project 2
## Quarantine Chat-Bot

## Description of project
Given the severity and escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic, quarantine has been put in place in many countries across the world. Since most of these quarantine processes involve people staying alone for an extended period of time (7, 14, 21 days etc), it is irrefutable that these people may face certain issues during their quarantine.

## Goal of project
Our goal for this project is to figure out exactly what are the biggest issues people undergoing quarantine face. After which, we want to carefully select the main issues that affect the most people, and incorporate our brainstormed ideas to fulfil the needs of these people.

We aim to incorporate these features in a quarantine chat-bot, with both useful functionalities, as well as a good user experience for users.

## Learning, Execution Process & Achievements
### Needfinding
Just like in project 1, my team and I decided to perform a survey via a Google form, to really find out what are the biggest issues that people undergoing quarantine face.

Here were their responses:

### POV
Based on their responses, we came up with a rough structure for our POV:

Target User:
People undergoing quarantine at home/in a hotel

Their Need:
- Medical advice when experiencing Covid-19 symptoms/ other symptoms
- Updates regarding the Covid-19/general situation
- Personal Reminders
- A form of entertainment
- A bot that seems as close to a real person as possible to increase interactivity

Insight:
People undergoing quarantine mainly face issues regarding physical and mental health. Hence, the best bot we can build is a bot which can tackle these issues.

We also came out with some POV statements for the user:
The user...
- gets anxious from feeling somewhat unwell, but doesn't know if they have Covid-19
- isn't aware of the current Covid-19 situation
- isn't aware of the general situation (e.g. weather)
- doesn't know if he/she can trust the information online, regarding the Covid-19 situation
- forgets to take temperature/ART tests regularly
- forgets which day of quarantine they are on/how many days they have left
- feels constantly bored due to the lack of social interaction

#### Persona
Based on the above, we then created personas - a description of 'fake' representative users.
In our case, we considered two potential types of users:

First, we have Bryan, a workaholic 30 year old man under quarantine for an overseas business trip. As a responsible man, Bryan wants to find out if his recent symptoms are Covid-19 related, and how to deal with it.

Next, we have Julia, a 22 year old student having quarantine before starting her exchange semester. As a forgetful person who easily gets bored, Julia wants to be able to keep track of her quarantine progress, as well as to keep herself entertained.

### Brainstorming
#### Mindmapping
Next, we immediately began to brainstorm ideas, jotting down everyone's ideas and opinions, before organising them into a mind map as shown below:

### Storyboarding
We then sketched out a potential storyline of users, including their frustrations before using our chat-bot, as well as their relief and content after using it.

## Video Demonstration
Next, we recorded a short video of our application prototype to demonstrate how it would be used, showcasing the features we have implemented:

## Some of Our Code
Below is also some of our code, leveraging Rasa, an open source conversational AI, built for multidisciplinary enterprise teams.

The above snippet, for example, shows how our chat-bot will show our user a progress bar, to update them on their quarantine process.

## Personal Reflection
### Knowledge Gained & Lessons Learnt
During this project, I worked mainly on the needfinding process, including creating the survey, scrutinising and internalising the results, as well as curating the POV information.

I realised the importance of first and foremost finding out what the frustrations of the users are, people coming up with features and a product to tackle them.

As much as Iâ€™ve learnt regarding the aforementioned, I did not get to work on the coding aspect of this project as much. Hence, I hope to be able to do so in future.
